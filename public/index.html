    <hr/>
<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
    <p>Although it might be because of the prequel infinity war ending but it a well known fact that the Avengers Endgame movie is by far the best one there ever was and there ever will be in the future. Not to forget the most iconic qoute from the film "I am Iron Man"</p>
<h3>Arcane: League of legends</h3>
    <p>The best anime created in my time especially because of the diffent style of characters they use for drawing </p>
<h3>The Twilight Saga Franchise</h3>
    <p>As far as romantic films go this one is by far the one that hit the spot. I just could never have enough of all 5 films</p>
